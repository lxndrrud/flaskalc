# Flask web app with SQLAlchemy ORM

My pet blog project.

[Link to deployed Heroku app](https://lxndrrud.herokuapp.com/)

It is a Flask app.

Project implements article-based blog/forum model. It supports authentication and authorization.
There is role division(admin-user).

I used SQLite - SQLAlchemy database to store and process data and I bound session to ORM with the help of Flask-Session.

Because I am not too good at front-end, I used Bootstrap to beatify project\`s appearance.

I used bcrypt to increase database safety.
